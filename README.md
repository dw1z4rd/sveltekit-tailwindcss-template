# Sveltekit App Template with TailwindCSS installed!

If you hate setting up tailwindcss each time you start writing a new sveltekit app, just clone this repo. It's already set up for you.
Just type:

```bash
# clone the repo into my-app directory
git clone git@github.com:dw1z4rd/sveltekit-template.git my-app

# install deps
cd my-app && npm i
```

That's all there is to it. Now you can forget about writing a bunch of dumb css every time you want to design a component. If you're like me, you pretty
much have every tailwindcss class memorized and find it to be so much more convenient than having to manually write out a bunch of <style></style> tags and css for each .svelte file. Also, if you're like me, you *really* hate having to go through the installation of tailwindcss into your project each and every time.

I made this template to save me a bunch of work each time. You're welcome to do whatever you want with it. It's nothing fancy, just a blank sveltekit app with tailwindcss already installed and configured for you.
